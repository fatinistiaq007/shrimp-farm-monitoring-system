### IOT based Fresh Water Shrimp Farm Monitoring System
## Introduction
The freshwater shrimp (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) fisheries sector has vital significance to the economy of Bangladesh. This sector plays an important role in supplying nutrition, employment creation, poverty alleviation and overseas currency acquisition. Rapid population growth, environmental pollution and global warming are reducing the production level of fisheries (freshwater shrimp) sector. There are various environmental metrics such as acidity and salinity level of water, turbidity, dissolved oxygen level etc. which play a vital role for effective production of shrimp. Constant or computerized monitoring system is the only way of handling those metrics in real time. Moreover, old-fashioned (manual) monitoring system is totally time consuming and never performed in real time. In order to address these problems, a real time shrimp (freshwater shrimp) farm monitoring system is presented in this paper. This monitoring system integrates technologies such as microcontroller based physical devices, internet of things (IoT) and web applications that allow users to remotely monitor a shrimp farm, as well as to receive alerts when an out-of-range water parameter (Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity level and turbidity of
water) is detected. The physical implementation of this system consists of a set of sensors that allow collecting data about the water metrics of shrimp farm. This system
was evaluated to test its effectiveness in terms of the size, weight, and the percentage of survival of the shrimp achieved when the shrimp culture pond is monitored by this system.
